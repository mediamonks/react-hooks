# useRegisterRef

A helper hook that allows you to easily register and access refs by "name", even supports arrays.

Due to the dynamic nature of collecting refs, it's tricky to know how many `useRef` calls you need
to consistently do without explicitly setting (and updating when your refs change) the amount.
This is why this hook doesn't use `useRef` at all, but stores the actual DOM elements directly.

This means that other hooks that rely on `ref.current` will not work. In that case you should
change the hook (if you can), or wrap your element inside a ref (TODO: this can be easily done
with the `todo` hook).

This hooks returns a `ref` object that will never change reference. Instead, the object will be
mutated to store the HTML elements. This will allow similar usages to `useRef`. `refs.item` for
example is similar to `ref.current` If you pass the `refs` object to other functions, it won't
need to be added to dependency arrays, but as soon as that code is executed, the updated value
will be available there.

> **Note** due to the general usage of refs on HTML elements, you will almost always have them
  available as soon as you execute code in a `useEffect`, and you wont use them anymore in an
  `unmout`. For this reason, the hook doesn't enforce the `| null` type on ref object keys, so
  you don't have to check for its existence in your code everytime you use it. If you do use
  optional refs, or in situations where they might not exist, you must explicitly type them as
  `| null` or as optional (`?`) in your `Refs` type.

## Reference

```ts
function useRegisterRef<T extends Record<string, unknown>>(): readonly [
  T,
  (name: string, index?: number) => (ref: Element | null) => void,
]
```

### Returns

* `[refs, registerRef]` - Define the return value here.
  * `refs` – An object with the registered DOM Elements, matching the structure and type of the
    passed `Refs` in the generics.
  * `registerRef` – A factory to create a scoped function to pass to the JSX `ref` attribute.
    You pass the name of the ref you want to capture (matching the `Refs` generics) and the
    index if you are registering a collection of items, and it returns a function that collects
    the React element under that name in the `refs` object.
    When using arrays (and your `Refs` defines something as an array), you have to append `[]`
    to the name of the ref, so we can turn on the array capture behaviour.

## Usage

```tsx
const [refs, registerRef] = useRegisterRef<Refs>();
````
```tsx
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { useRegisterRef } from '@mediamonks/react-hooks';

type Refs = {
  element: HTMLDivElement;
  elements: ReadonlyArray<HTMLSpanElement>;
}

function DemoComponent() {
  const [refs, registerRef] = useRegisterRef<Refs>();

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log(refs.element) // HTMLDivElement
    console.log(refs.elements); // Array<HTMLSpanElement>
  }, []);

  return (
    <div ref={registerRef('element')}>
      {['AA', 'BB'].map((item, index) => (
        <span key={item} ref={registerRef('elements[]', index)}>{item}</span>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```
